# Plagiarism_detector_Python
I created this solution for a problem on the Python course of Georgia Tech.
The program can compare a file to other selected files searching for plagiarism. It consider any instances of 5 or more consecutive words appearing in both files as plagiarism.
The user can select multiple files in the same time to compare them to the investigated file. Sample files are uploaded.
To be a little more convenient to use I added a TKinter interface to this version.
